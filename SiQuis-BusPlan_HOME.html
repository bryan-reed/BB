                      The concept of classified ads began appearing in England in the 1600s. Handwritten messages were nailed to posts by scribes and became known as “Si Quis”,[5] a term borrowed from ancient Rome where most posted notices began with the words Si Quis — meaning "If anybody knows of…"

                      Today the sheer number and variety of classifieds worldwide has grown exponentially into broad, albeit fragmented horizontal markets. Never before has creating and posting a “Si Quis” been so easy and affordable with a reach far beyond the street posts of the 17th century.

                      The concept of classified ads began appearing in England in the 1600s. Handwritten messages were nailed to posts by scribes and became known as “Si Quis”, a term borrowed from ancient Rome where most posted notices began with the words Si Quis — meaning "If anybody knows of…"
                      <br><br>
                      Today the sheer number and variety of classifieds worldwide has grown exponentially into broad, albeit fragmented horizontal markets. Never before has creating and posting a “Si Quis” been so easy and affordable with a reach far beyond the street posts of the 17th century.   
                      <br><br>
                      Most importantly however, never before have individuals had the resources to pursue things they are passionate about, which brings us to back to our name… Si Quis Software.   
                      <br><br>
                      We've taken liberty to expand upon the definitions of "Si Quis", taking it beyond the concept of classifieds in the 1600's and associating it with the emergence of the Passion Economy of the 21st century. "If anybody knows of something related to my passions…”

                      Classified ads began appearing in England in the 1600s. They were handwritten, and nailed to posts. Scribes made their living writing announcements, which were, for all intents and purposes, classified ads. And these ads weren't called ads — they were called Si quis.<br>

                        Simply put, the Passion Economy is a new wave of niche communities that are challenging traditional social media giants.

                    Without something tangible to monetize, entrepreneurs interested in following their passions as a career are unable to create sustainable businesses online.

            Si Quis Software <i>(Siquisoft.com)</i><a class="text-info link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalInfonotes"><small>(1)</small></a> is a Pacific Northwest based software development company. We create a customizable framework for people to build, manage and grow “passion-based” businesses online. Virtually any type of passion-based business is possible and virtually any number of unique websites can be built using our framework.

            <br><br>
            We view passion-based businesses as verticals within horizontal markets that are uniquely positioned to appeal to highly productive market segments (fiercely passionate individuals) by focusing on their core interests and commerce within these verticals.
            <br><br>

            The emergence of the “Passion Economy” — a new model of internet-powered entrepreneurship,<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[2]</small></a> is gaining momentum in both number of participants and financial opportunity. It is the space in which Si Quis Software intends to operate. <a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[3]</small></a> More about the "Passion Economy" in Section 10 below.  
            <br><br>

            The Si Quis platform is different from other platforms operating within the Passion Economy. We not only enable creators, influencers and gig-economy professional to build new businesses or enhance their existing ones, we make it possible for virtually anyone who has experiences, expertise and knowledge about something they are truly passionate about to build a business, create community and monetize the audience.

            <hr>

            Without something tangible to monetize, entrepreneurs interested in following their passions as a career find it difficult, if not impossible to create  sustainable businesses online.
            <br><br>
            <i class="text-info">That said, ideas that are not apparent are often the biggest ideas. AirBnB is a good example. Who thought there was a business with private room renting to compete with hotels?</i>
            <br><br>

            <b class="">Two Sets Of Problems:</b><br>
            Our client's problems, and their customer's problems. We solve for both of them.
            <br><br>

            <b class="">Problems Our Clients Face:</b><br>
            Today, entrepreneurs (creators, influencers and merchants) have multiple options available to them to set up and operate online businesses. Yet they all have one thing in common; they need something tangible to monetize. Additionally, many of these entrepreneurs are looking for ways to monetize passively and not be constantly looking for their next engagement or product (content or merchandise) to sell.  
            <br><br>

            For people or entities that do not have something tangible to monetize, there are few options beyond the Meta Platforms. In this scenario, building community, creating value and capturing that value requires multiple and likely disparate platforms to create financial critical mass, creating complexities in management and systems integration. 
            <br><br>

            Of no less significance, the past 18 months has intensified work/life balance requirements for many and created a need to establish meaningful and sustainable work remotely. On a brighter side of this requirement many people are also interested in pursuing their passion as a career. 
            <br><br>

            <strong><div class="text-danger mb-5">

            The US is approaching 1.8 billion websites and growing at double digit rates and on average, 4.4 million blog posts occur every day in the US. Finding credible, relevant and timely information about individual interest is becoming complicated and time consuming. Although finding products (new and used) and services is relatively easy to do on-line, buying and selling remains primarily transactional and does little to foster the interactions that build community and trust around brands, products and services. Moreover, people are craving privacy, safety, and a respite from the throngs of people on social platforms. All of this and more represents an emerging dynamic that people are facing and looking to change.<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[3]</small></a>

                <br><br>

                Our previous experiences as b2b ecommerce and channel management solution providers has given us a perspective on how best to organize and structure our platform to provide people with a turn-key solution to manage and grow their passion-based businesses. 
                <br><br>

                We believe there are four fundamental components; Content, Resources, Conversations and Commerce that are necessary to build and foster healthy communities around deeply keen interests. It's true the large social media companies are doing most of this already, but the main difference it THEY own the platform and the majority of the revenue a user generates. The Si Quis platform is about giving power to people with an opportunity to keep all of the revenue generated from their knowledge, efforts and passion! We took these time-honored fundamentals and re-imagined them for the digital era, interwoven into a single community platform and tunable to a viewer's interests.

                <br><br>

                The websites our clients create are for people who are genuinely passionate about something. Our clients customers (viewers, members etc.) can create profiles that are stored and used by us to aggregate information, products, services and conversations relevant to their interests.

                There are multiple opportunities to monetize sites, including internal and external advertising revenue, membership fees, classified listing fees and e-commerce sales, generating recurring revenue from an assortment of intangible and tangible products.
                <br><br>

                While the look and feel of each website is unique, the infrastructure supporting them is not. Our back-end management systems provide administrative functionality to autonomously manage, maintain, market and monetize the websites.

                In addition, our full-stack, multi-tenant system architecture ensures we are able to efficiently and cost effectively maintain our client’s sites, keep track of billing information and grow our revenue streams as our client's businesses thrive.

            <h2 class="text-info" id="5_Passion_Economy">5 | The Passion Economy</h2>
            <hr>

            The digital era has given rise to a number of spectacular "economies". The attention economy, the gig-economy and of course the digital-economy,<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes">[4]</a></i> to name just a few, are responsible for trillions of dollars in economic turn. As these economies mature, fractures in the mechanics of these economies are forcing people to re-address how they make money.
            <br><br>

            The Passion Economy took shape in 2019/2020 when Li Jin<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes">[1]</a></i> and Adam Davidson,<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes">[2]</a></i> with their independent and pioneering work on identifying and describing its presence, brought to the attention of the world an economic explosion underway.
            <br><br>

            The Passion Economy is an emergence of niche communities, powered by digital platforms that are challenging the business models of traditional social media giants.<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes">[6]</a></i> The TAM in 2020 was estimated to be worth ~$38 Billion USD and growing rapidly.<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes">[7]</a></i>
            <br><br>

            The entrepreneurs driving this trend are creating niche communities focused on creating and sharing content that resonates with individuals, and surprisingly given the value of the TAM, creating value within a "micro-network effects" space, or tightly-knit clusters.<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes">[14,15]</a></i> This is significant for many reasons, but foremost it is creating and capturing a higher degree of value from smaller verticals (cohorts) within large horizontal markets.
            <br><br>

            Looking at some drivers that are fracturing these economies, lets first take a look at the gig-economy. It's well understood the incredibly efficient digital tools powering it have commoditized freelancers and tied them to time sheets, trading hours for money. It's a race to the bottom, or lowest cost, truly a one-sided buyer’s market.<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes">[5]</a></i> 
            <br><br>

            The attention economy has its critics as well. A quick look at Facebook's 2020<a class="text-info link lift ms-1" 
            href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680119000009/fb-12312018x10k.htm">FORM 10-K Annual Report</a> details gross advertising revenue of $84.17 billion USD, roughly 98% of their total revenue. This implies a revenue stream heavily dependent upon advertising spends, most of which is becoming more and more interested in reaching targeted audiences.
            <br><br>

            The Passion Economy<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[6]</small></a> was largely born out of the waning interest put in the attention economy. Consumers have few illusions about how big social media is profiting from their attention and the practices are beginning to tire them. Emerging out of this exhaustion, the Passion Economy has created space for interactions that are based on sincere, shared passions and interests. 
            <br><br>

            Advertisers as well see the Passion Economy as a way to boost ROIs even more on digital advertising by reaching targeted, niche audiences.<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[20]</small></a>

                  <br>
                  In recent months, much has been written about the Passion Economy. We've traced its origins back to <a class="text-info link ms-1" href="https://www.atelierventures.co/team">Li Jin</a>, Partner at Atelier, an early-stage VC firm and <a class="text-info link ms-1" href="https://adamdavidson.com">Adam Davidson</a>, an American journalist, author and co-founder of NPR's Planet Money program, when in late 2019, early 2020 respectively, they interchangeably became known with defining the space. And rightfully so, the rise of the Passion Economy is now here. Moreover, recent socioeconomic trends and catastrophic global events have converged and are accelerating its growth.
                  <br><br>

                  The Passion Economy is a new wave of niche communities that are challenging traditional social media giants. Instead of the generalized and non-specific content of larger social media platforms, the niche communities focus on creating and sharing content that resonates with individuals.
                  <br><br>

                  The Passion Economy also differs from what’s known as the gig-economy. The gig-economy represents a free market system in which organizations and independent workers engage in short-term work arrangements. It is estimated that the Global gig-economy will be worth $347 billion USD in 2021

                  Although the passion, gig and attention economies are fundamentally different, the Passion Economy may very well track the economic trajectory of these economies through disruption of the very same! As more and more individuals look to create meaningful financial and quality of life choices, the Passion Economy will disrupt traditional business models and tap into revenue streams largely controlled by the social media and "semi" big tech giants.

            <b>"Curators" and "Creators"</b>
            <br>

            We believe there is an untapped segment of the global population looking to create financially sustainable businesses around their passions. These are people who are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about something, but not particularly extraordinary at creating products and/or services within that space that performs well in the Creator / Influencer space. We think of them broadly as "Curators". In addition, many within the creator space are looking to share their expertise, knowledge and experiences, as well as their creations, in ways that will generate passive income.
            <br><br>

            Technically, these "Curators" and "Creators" are disproportionately weighted more heavily in the Gen Z (68.2M US | 2.0B Globally) and Millennial (73.0 US | 1.88B Globally<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[16]</small></a> population segments, although many others today are involved in the Creator-Economy now estimated at 50M globally. <a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[19]</small></a> Moreover, many businesses are interested in creating meaningful and authentic relationships with their clients and looking to connect with people who share their passions.

            The Passion Economy is just now entering its expansion phase. Although there are numerous entities scrambling to create the right set of tools to address the market's rise, we've taken a step back and looked closely at how the Passion Economy thrived prior to today's spotlight.

            We found two companies in particular that resonate with our vision of a thriving Passion Economy and took a deep look at the things driving their success.

                  April, 2000 marked the humble beginnings of SuperCub.org.

                    Sometime in 2001, a small envelope addressed to the website owner arrived with a Yankton, SD postmark. There were no other markings. Inside was a one hundred-dollar bill wrapped in a hand-written note saying, "I like what you are doing, keep it up". Later, the site owner learned that the money was sent by Dave Tunge, who will always be known as the "Grandfather of SuperCub.Org". This singular generous gift inspired literally thousands of hours of work developing SuperCub.Org into an interactive pilot community and became the basis for the way SuperCub.Org operates today.
                    <br><br>

                    SuperCub.Org reaches a wide variety of pilots who are interested in not only Supercubs, PA-12's, and certificated and experimental variants, but also a great number of other airplanes used in bush operations and the pursuit of back country flying - as well as all the other necessities that go along with them. 
                    <br><br>

                    SuperCub.org generates revenue through annual membership fees at varying levels from $25 to $1000 per member. In addition, the site generates revenue through advertising, classifieds listings and e-commerce sales. The site owner has created a niche, passion-based business, and is considered the epicenter for all things related to flying, owning, maintaining, building and storytelling about Super Cub aircraft. 
                    <br><br>

                    SuperCub.Org receives approximately 95,000 unique visitors per month on their home page. The popular forums have received even more traffic. They have over 13,000 registered members, and nearly ten times as many "lurkers" that read and enjoy their forums and other information available on the site publicly. <a class="row d-inline text-info ms-2" href="#SuperCub" data-scroll onclick="changeText5()" id="myBtn5">Read less...</i></a>

            In both case studies the site owners were not creators, influencers or merchants when they got started. They were individuals who early on followed their passions and created websites that contained four key fundamentals; <i><b>Content, Resources, Conversations and Commerce,</b></i> about things they were deeply interested in. 
            <br><br>

            As noted above, "thousands of hours" went into creating their platforms and is an economic and technical barrier for others to create. We believe our platform is a turn-key solution to address these needs and play a leadership role in the thriving Passion Economy for "Curators" and "Creators" alike.

            The market opportunity for Si Quis Software is broad, underserved and supported by financial opportunity for our clients. Moreover, our target audience is not age specific, location specific or industry specific. Virtually anyone can join the Passion Economy using our platform.<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[13]</small></a>
            <br><br>

           Many people in the know would say quantifying the Passion Economy is difficult, if not impossible at this early stage. That said, researchers have pegged the 2019 Passion Economy Total Addressable Market (TAM) at roughly USD $38.16 Billion.<a class="text-success link ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[7]</small></a>  
           <br><br>

           We would argue the TAM of the Passion Economy is larger, or at a minimum, has a greater potential than what's been reported. In general, we believe the Passion Economy is fueled by economic activity from an array of diverse segments, and the disruptive nature of the Passion Economy engine is getting its gas from them all. If we look closely at just a few sectors fueling its potential; online advertising, classified advertising, e-commerce sales and "gig" markets alone, the economic turn is in the trillions and under threat of disruption.

            Each of the TAM segments will contribute to the Passion Economy’s growth at varying degrees. In our analysis we believe the Passion Economy will create incremental economic activity across all sectors but will disruptively migrate economic activity towards the “new owners” and away from the traditional norms of today. 
            <br><br>

            Companies that have largely kept advertising revenue for themselves will see competition for these dollars as the Passion Economy platforms provide better access to the audiences driving these spends.<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[9]</small></a> To what degree the disruptive migration takes place remains unclear. But a quick look back at the “Passion Economy”, from <$5.0B to $38B in the past 3 or 4 years, would suggest a groundswell afoot.<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[10]</small></a> As previously stated, we believe big social media platforms are at risk and will experience an accelerating loss in existing and incremental revenue streams. We believe the Passion Economy TAM will eclipse $50 billion by the end of December 2023, representing a CAGR of approximately 14.5%, generally on par with the CAGRs of the TAM segments mentioned above.

            A cultural shift in the way people work is underway. 
            The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated online economic activity and reconfigured the way in which people work.<a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[12]</small></a> Although not seamless, the financial and social impacts of working remotely has given rise to a collective desire to work differently across a broad spectrum of disciplines. Moreover, an increasing number of digital platforms are enabling individuals to create, foster and grow meaningful and sustainable businesses of all types <i><b>never before imagined.</b></i>
            <br><br>

            Looking at a three-year horizon based upon the size of the Passion Economy TAM today, we see a serviceable obtainable market (SOM) size of ~$200+ million for Si Quis Software.

            We know that there is an underserved segment of the Passion Economy yet to emerge. While its actually been around for quite some time, it is largely owned by a brave few <i>(like The Samba, Subercub.org and others)</i> who have had to build their own platforms. 
            <br><br>

            We intend to perfect that platform, making it a turn-key and customizable platform for virtually anyone interested in following their passions.

            Our platform is positioned to address segments of the market that are underserved, opening an untapped subset of people looking to join the Passion Economy. In addition, our platform is equally positioned to amplify existing passion-based business by providing functionality not present in the competitor landscape and provide avenues to generate passive income.
            <br><br>
           
            We've structured our revenue model to be approachable and flexible with two entry points and price levels to accommodate "new-to-market" or "well-established" businesses. This allows clients to invest in what they need now to grow their business and seamlessly layer in additional access and feature sets as business and needs grow. In addition we kept the pricing model simple, making it a transparent and fair value proposition.
            <br><br>

            In general, all platforms come with our four fundamental components (Content, Directory, Forum and Classified modules) that clients can set-up, customize and activate within the system's ADMIN instance. The new-to-market accounts have lower threshold limits on a variety of functions within the site (easily expandable) and no access to APIs for integrations to third party applications like QuickBooks, Shopify, etc. The well-established clients have higher threshold limits and access to APIs for integrations to a list of third-party applications as well as some additional features not present on the entry level package.
            <br><br>

            All client on-boarding, account setup, feature activations and thresholds are setup and modified in the Si Quis ADMIN-1 client management instance. ADMIN-1 is our "back-end" instance, provisioning and enabling all of our clients via a typical multi-tenant configuration that keeps track of clients, their level of service, feature sets, pricing and more.
            <br><br>

            Our revenue model provides an ever-increasing and recurring stream of income, enabling us to leverage our existing resources and attract and hire the expertise we need to strengthen our team, create value for our clients and grow shareholder value.

            <b>Round Information</b><br>
            Si Quis Software, LLC is seeking to raise $500,000 USD in the form of (a) sale of Preferred Stock in the amount of $500,000 with a pre-money valuation of $5,000,000 USD, representing a 9.09% equity interest in Si Quis Software, Inc. The “first money” in will receive an additional 5% in Warrants. 
            <br><br>

            (b) We anticipate securing a Series A round of financing of $2,000,000 to $5,000,000 to accelerate growth of Si Quis Software 12 months after the initial round of financing.
            <br><br>

            The proceeds will be used to: <br>
                (i) complete "front-end" programming of the Siquisoft platform (the "beta-site"), <br>
                (ii) launch a version of the beta-site (planned as "Aircraftwest"), <br>
                (iii) operate the beta-site in real-time, <br>
                (iv) Launch 2nd and 3rd beta-sites with development partners, <br>
                (v) accelerate back-end programming of the Siquisoft platform and <br>
                (vi) fund general operations for approximately one year. 
            <br><br>

            The table below approximates the projected income statement above and can be used to model different assumptions relative to projected number of clients and the revenue and expense generated for years 1 through 5 post financing. The "Default" settings represent our "envisioned" path.

            <div class="mt-5 mb-2"><b>Our go-to-market strategy</b> - Three-phase approach:</div>
            
            <b>Phase 1: </b><br>
            Completing and deploying an initial beta-site owned and operated by Si Quis. We are creating a "front-end" version of the Si Quis platform to setup and operate a passion-based business in the aviation sector. This site will contain all four of the fundamentals discussed above and many of the features we expect to bring forward in the production ("Prod") version. <i class="text-muted">We selected the Aviation space because of Brent's passion for all things aviation and the relatively broad horizontal market.</i>
            <br><br>

            Once deployed, a host of marketing strategies will be utilized including; Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (SEM), Pay Per Click or Pay Per Call (PPC), Content Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Email Marketing, Influencer Marketing, Affiliate Marketing and Reputation marketing. In addition, certain events in the aviation industry (Airshows) are places to showcase the application. Some of these strategies will be used more than others with a goal of better understanding how a Si Quis platform will benefit from these different activities.
            <br><br>

            We have allocated approximately 6 months to finalize the front-end development and beta testing of the site (depicted in the forecast Income Statement). After certain goals are met we plan to launch our "Power" plan and "Professional" plan packages with additional feature sets following later in that initial fiscal year.
            <br><br>

            <b>Phase 2: </b><br>
            In addition to the company owned beta-site, we intend to contract with two separate development-partners, creating passion-based businesses of different types using the Si Quis platform. These instances will be used to expand upon our marketing strategies and gain insight into system functionality, ease of use and metrics to help us fine tune the Si Quis platform programming needs, AI algorithm models and monetization models.
            <br><br>

            Addressing the "Cold Start Problem" (as described by Andrew Chen - The Cold Start Problem) <a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[15]</small></a> will be our primary objective for Aircraftwest, our development-partner sites and Si Quis Software. Marketing activities will include 3rd party lead generation and SEO tools (Hubspot, Iterable, Brightspot, etc...), in-house promotion, social media and trade shows. We anticipate an introductory pricing model to build awareness and acceptance as well.
            <br><br>

            During the Phase 2 time period, our development team will be finalizing the back-end attributes of the platform and finishing programming needs to ready the application for Prod status. We expect this to be complete within 6 months from the launch of the initial beta-site.
            <br><br>

            <div class="mb-5"><b>Phase 3: </b>Launch of the site and the efforts that go along with it are in full swing. Marketing spends as well as staff requirements will increase to anticipate new business.</div>

              We believe our solution of combining core interests and commerce will transform the way people and companies balance work/life needs and turn their passions into profits. Now, more than ever, regardless of who coined the term, or how it's described, the "Passion Economy" is here and it is on the rise.

              <div class="container">
              <span class="text-secondary"><i><b>Sara Wilson</b>, an LA-based digital strategist and founder of SW Projects described these passion-based business as "digital campfires. She writes in the Harvard Business Review:<span><a class="text-success link lift ms-1" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="#modalFootnotes"><small>[14]</small></a></span> "Without question, the digital campfire trend is firmly on the radar of the big social platforms...

                    Zuckerberg is paying attention to this shift not only because the data shows that Facebook is losing young audiences, but because the re-direction of attention to more private modes of communication represents a major challenge for the company.
                    <br><br>

                    It is neither simple nor straightforward to reach audiences gathered around digital campfires. But as traditional social platforms grow, they become more crowded, and it becomes more difficult and expensive to reach people there anyway. In light of this, digital campfires become a much more attractive alternative — one that requires more groundwork and more careful tending, but one that could potentially have big payoffs for brands in terms of loyalty, retention, and long-term love.

                    COMPANY RISK FACTORS<br>
                    The following Risk Factors have been prepared by the Company and will be circulated to all prospective investors in the Preferred Stock offering. Si Quis Software, LLC has not had an independent third party approved or disapproved of these Risk Factors and has not independently determined whether such Risk Factors are accurate or complete.
                    <br><br>

                    An investment in the Company involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors of substantial means who have no immediate need for liquidity of the amount invested, and who can afford a risk of loss of all or a substantial part of such investment. In addition to the other information contained in this Agreement, you should carefully consider the following risks before making an investment decision. Due to the growth stage of the Company and these other risks, you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently thinks are immaterial, may also impair the Company's business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer. In such case, you may lose all or part of the money you paid.
                    <br><br>

                    The Company has a product that has been proven with little adoption. The Company has spent the past 5 years developing and modifying the existing platform to meet the needs of wholesale-distributor clients. The company has not undertaken the task of marketing and selling the platform actively and can make no assurances the markets will adopt the technology.
                    <br><br>

                    The Company has a limited operating history. Since the Company was first formed, it has not produced a profit. There is no assurance that it will ever produce a profit or that, if it achieves profitability, it will be able to sustain it. As a new enterprise with a unique product offering, it is likely to be subject to risks its management has not anticipated, which may adversely impact its operations.
                    <br><br>

                    Financial forecasts are for illustrative purposes only. Any projected or proforma financial statements delivered to prospective investors ("Financial Forecasts") are for illustrative purposes only and must not be relied upon by the prospective investor. The Financial Forecasts reflect estimates of future results of operations developed by the Company without independent evaluation or analysis, and are based upon assumptions that may or may not occur and over which the Company will have little or no control. For instance, the cost of capital and professional services are inherently difficult to predict, and the Company may have to spend more on these items than the budgeted amount. The assumptions made by the Company are inherently subjective. There can be no assurance that actual events will correspond with these assumptions, and costs in excess of budget will impact the Company's ability to achieve its projections. Actual results for any period may or may substantially not conform to the Financial Forecasts.
                    <br><br>

                    The Company has capital needs. The Company has limited resources. If it does not conclude the Preferred Stock offering it will lack funds to grow the operations. Furthermore, the Company's operations are expected to continue to consume substantial amounts of cash following the Preferred Stock offering, and the development and marketing of the Company's products will require a commitment of substantial additional funds. This may require additional financings. If the Company is unable to raise the funds sought in future financings, when needed, it may lack sufficient capital to execute its business plan. Additionally, unforeseen expenses, including such things as changing customer requirements or additional functionality required to remain relevant could cause the Company to consume funds more rapidly.
                    <br><br>

                    The Company may not have sufficient financial resources to successfully compete in the Passion Economy. There are a number of enterprises that are striving to provide products or services that are similar in nature to the Si Quis Software platform. The Company will be competing with established businesses that have an operating history, and greater financial resources, management experience and market share. There can be no assurance that Si Quis Software will be able to compete or capture adequate market share. The Company will not be profitable if it cannot compete successfully with other businesses.
                    <br><br>

                    Si Quis Software depends on the services of key employees that would be difficult to replace. The Company's success depends substantially on the services of key personnel, Brent Bostwick, Managing Member and Bryan Reed, Member and Technology Officer. The Company's success depends on the performance of these personnel and on its ability to retain and motivate high quality personnel, especially its management. The Company's future success depends on its continuing ability to identify, attract and retain highly qualified personnel and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.
                    <br><br>

                    Previous to the closing of the Convertible Note, the Company's financial statements have been unaudited. While the Company believes its current and previous financial statements are accurate, they have not been audited by an independent qualified organization. Errors or misunderstandings in those statements could misrepresent the Company's current financial position. (Following the closing of this Preferred Stock offering, the financial statements will be annually audited by an independent qualified organization).
                    <br><br>

                    There is control by Principal Stockholders. The Company's founders currently control a large majority of the Company's outstanding voting shares, and, accordingly, they are able to exert substantial influence over the Company.
                    <br><br>

                    There will likely be a lack of Dividends or Other Distributions. It is unlikely that the Company will pay cash dividends or make any other distributions in respect of the Preferred Stock in the foreseeable future.

                              The concept of classified ads began appearing in England in the 1600s. Handwritten messages were nailed to posts by scribes and became known as “Si Quis”,[5] a term borrowed from ancient Rome where most posted notices began with the words Si Quis — meaning "If anybody knows of…"
                              <br><br>
                              Today the sheer number and variety of classifieds worldwide has grown exponentially into broad, albeit fragmented horizontal markets. Never before has creating and posting a “Si Quis” been so easy and affordable with a reach far beyond the street posts of the 17th century.   
                              <br><br>
                              Most importantly however, never before have individuals had the resources to pursue things they are passionate about, which brings us to back to our name… Si Quis Software.

                              We've taken liberty to expand upon the definitions of "Si Quis", taking it beyond the concept of classifieds in the 1600's and associating it with the emergence of the Passion Economy of the 21st century. "If anybody knows of something related to my passions…”

Scribes made their living writing announcements, which were, for all intents and purposes, classified ads. And these ads weren't called ads — they were called Si quis.<br>
